## Analysis

### Success Factors
1. **High Resolution**: T1 images (640×640) had significantly better results
2. **Good Feature Count**: T1 consistently detected 300-500 features
3. **Similar Viewpoints**: T1 normal and faulty images were taken from similar angles
4. **Sufficient Texture**: T1 thermal patterns provided enough distinct features

### Failure Factors
1. **Low Resolution**: T2, T3, T4, T5 had lower resolutions
2. **Limited Features**: Smaller images provided fewer features for matching
3. **Viewpoint Changes**: Some faulty images may have different camera angles
4. **Visual Differences**: Significant thermal pattern differences reduced matchable features

## Recommendations

### For T1 (Working Well)
- Continue using current configuration
- Consider lowering minimum match threshold to 15 for borderline cases
- Implement quality checks on aligned images

### For T2, T3, T4, T5 (Not Working)
1. **Reduce Minimum Matches**: Lower threshold from 20 to 10 or even 5
2. **Adjust Border Crop**: Reduce from 10% to 5% for smaller images
3. **Increase Ratio Test**: Relax from 0.65 to 0.75 for more matches
4. **Try Different Methods**:
   - ORB: Faster, might work better on low-res images
   - AKAZE: Good for difficult matching scenarios
5. **Consider Manual Alignment**: For very different images, manual registration may be needed
6. **Upscale Images**: Consider upscaling smaller images before processing

## Next Steps

1. **Adjust Parameters** for smaller transformers (T2-T5)
2. **Implement Quality Metrics** to validate alignment quality
3. **Add Visualization** to review aligned images
4. **Create Overlays** to visually compare normal vs aligned faulty images
5. **Consider Alternative Methods** for failed cases (template matching, deep learning)

## Script Usage

```bash
# Run the alignment script
python transform_and_align_images.py
```

The script will:
- Process all transformer types automatically
- Save aligned images to `Dataset_Aligned/` directory
- Use the normal image filename as base for aligned images
- Add `_aligned_N` suffix for multiple faulty images
- Print detailed progress and statistics
